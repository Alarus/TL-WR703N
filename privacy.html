	<h2 id="privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</h2>
	<p>, weI have three fundamental principles about privacy:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>I don't ask you for personal information unless we need it.</li>
	  <li>I don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
	  <li>I don't store your personal information on the servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these principles.</p>
	<p>I ("Michel Stempin", "the owner") operate squonk42.github.com/TL-WR703N/. It is my policy to respect your privacy regarding any information I collect while operating our websites.</p>
	<h2 id="website-visitors">Website Visitors</h2>
	<p>Like most sites, this site collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as your browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. My purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to understand how you use our website. From time to time, I may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a blog post on trends in the rapidly increasing usage of its website.</p>
	<p>Thissite also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. I only disclose IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>
	<h2 id="gathering-of-personally-identifying-information">Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
	<p>Some visitors to this website choose to interact with it in ways that require me to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that this site gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. Those who engage in transactions with this site -- by donating, for example -- are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, I collect such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with this site . I do not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. You can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent you from engaging in certain activities. For example, I can't ship you something if you won't tell me your shipping address.</p>
	<h2 id="aggregated-statistics">Aggregated Statistics</h2>
	<p>I collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to this website. For instance, I uses Google Analytics to figure out what links or web searches brought you to me. This site may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, I do not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
	<h2 id="protection-of-certain-personally-identifying-information">Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
	<p>I disclose potentially personally-identifying information only to contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it my behalf or to provide services available at this website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country. Shopify, for example, is in Canada. By using this website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.</p>
	<p>I will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, I disclose potentially personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when I believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or my rights, third parties or the public at large.</p>
	<p>If you have supplied your email address to me, I may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or keep you up to date with what's going on with TL-WR703N and other finely engineered products. I primarily use the blog to communicate this type of information, so I expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send me a request (for example via a support email or via one of the feedback mechanisms), I reserve the right to publish it in order to help me clarify or respond to your request or to help me support other users. If you want me to stop emailing you, just ask, and I stop.</p>
	<p>I take all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying information.</p>
	<h2 id="cookies">Cookies</h2>
	<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. This website uses cookies to help me identify and track visitors, their usage of this website, and the website access preferences. Visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using this website, with the drawback that certain features of the website may not function properly without the aid of cookies. In particular, refusing cookies will prevent forum posting and the use of the store.</p>
	<h2 id="privacy-policy-changes">Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
	<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, I may change the privacy policy from time to time, and at my sole discretion. I encourage visitors to check this page for any changes to its privacy policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this privacy policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
