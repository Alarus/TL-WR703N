        <h3>What?</h3>

<p>Unlike what it is marketed for, the TP-LINK® TL-WR703N is not a “3G travel router”: it does not include a 3G modem at all, it simply means that the firmware support external USB 3G modems!</p>

<p>Despite this shortcoming, at less than $23, this device is the cheapest Wi-Fi router you can get west of the Pecos River! For this ridiculously low price, you get:</p>

<ul>
<li>A clean, small (57 mm x 57 mm x 18 mm) shiny white/light blue cover plastic case with rounded corners that is pretty easy to open with just a spudger or any other thin and resistant tool</li>
<li>An Atheros AR9331 chipset with

<ul>
<li>An Atheros AR7040 400 MHz MISP24kc CPU</li>
<li>Integrated 802.11n 150 Mbps (130 Mbps real) Wi-Fi with 20 dB (100 mW) output power</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>4 MB of serial (SPI) Flash memory</li>
<li>32 MB of DDR SDRAM</li>
<li>An USB 2.0 host port</li>
<li>A shielded Ethernet 10/100 Mbps RJ45 jack</li>
<li>An external power supply using a provided wall plug via a micro-USB socket</li>
<li>A software-controlled reset pinhole switch</li>
<li>A blue surface-mounted LED (that can be replaced by a 3 mm through-hole LED)</li>
<li>A built-in Wi-Fi printed antenna (that can be replaced by an external one)</li>
<li>An UART accessible via 2 tiny pads that provides access to the uBoot bootloader and the Linux 2.6 console</li>
</ul><p>This device was released in August 2011 in China, and is not exported, though it is easy to get one on eBay.</p>

<p>There is also a closely related sister device as the TP-LINK® TL-MR3020 for the export market, with the following differences:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is CE/FCC certified</li>
<li>It has 4 additional surface-mounted LEDs</li>
<li>It has an additional sliding switch with 3 positions</li>
<li>The reset button is combined with the WPS LED</li>
<li>It has 2 Wi-Fi printed antennas, but only one is actually used</li>
<li>The RJ45 Ethernet jack is not shielded</li>
<li>The UART is available on a nice 0.1” pitch through-hole connector (not mounted)</li>
<li>It is larger: 67 mm x 74 mm x 22 mm)</li>
<li>It is more expensive: 9 on eBay</li>
</ul><h3>Why?</h3>

<p>Despite its interesting characteristics, the TL-WR703N router suffers from a complete lack of information regarding its implementation:</p>

<ul>
<li>No source code provided by the OEM manufacturer, although it is clearly using open-source software for building its firmware</li>
<li>The datasheet for the main chip (Atheros AR9331) is only available under NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement)</li>
<li>No available schematic, layout or BOM (Bill Of Materials) files</li>
</ul><p>However, people started to imagine unforeseen applications for the cheapest available embedded Linux platform on the market, ranging from software-only firmware customization using the dedicated <a href="https://openwrt.org/">OpenWRT distribution</a>, to hardware hacks involving fine pitch soldering in order to control various physical devices.</p>

<p>The hardware-focused projects using the TL-WR703N tend to be centralized in a few OpenWRT forum threads (<a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=36471">[1]</a>, <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=38994">[2]</a>, <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=39567">[3]</a>, <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=34437">[5]</a>, and <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=31729">[6]</a>), and rapidly focused on the research of available I/O resources and low-level electronic understanding.
Although some progress has been made, like an almost exhaustive main AR9331 chip pinout and a component-by-component description, only a full reverse-engineering work can provide the answers to all the questions on the hardware.</p>

<p>So this reverse-engineering of the TP-LINK® TL-WR703N router hardware is not purposed to reproduce it, but to provide a full understanding of it. This job has not economic goal, being aimed only towards acquiring knowledge on this amazing little device.</p>

<h3>Who?</h3>

<p>This is the work of a single person (Michel Stempin), based on the <a href="http://www.kean.com.au/oshw/WR703N/teardown/">TP-LINK® TL-WR703N teardown</a> performed by Kean from the OpenWRT forum.</p>

<h3>Where?</h3>

<p>All the resulting files are available in the <a href="https://github.com/Squonk42/TL-WR703N">corresponding GitHub repository</a>, and discussions are taking place into the corresponding threads from the <a href="https://forum.openwrt.org/">OpenWRT forum</a>.</p>

<p>So any question, idea, remark can be posted there!</p>

<p>W###hen?
This work took around 150 hours (2 week-ends and all the evenings in-between on my spare time) to produce a first PCB layout from the raw PCB top and bottom pictures.</p>

<p>But spare time costs nothing, and hobbyist motivation is higher than normal paid work!</p>
